            In this game, your <span class="term">Spymaster</span> will give you a single word clue and a number of agents that the clue relates to. It is your job pick out those agents.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>But be careful!</strong> Some of the cards are not your agents.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some are <span class="grey">civilians </span>(like {{civilianName}}) - pick one and your turn ends.</li>
            <li>Some are on <span class="red">another team</span> - pick one and your turn ends, plus you've helped out the other team!</li>
            <li>There is even an <span class="black">assassin</span> - pick him and you lose the round!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>First team to find all of their agents wins the round!</p>

        <h1>Being Spymaster</h1>
        <p>Each round, every team has a different Spymaster. When you are spymaster you will have to give a clue on each of your turns. Think of a word that relates to some of your agents but not the enemy agents <strong>and definitely not the assasin!</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clues must be <strong>one word</strong>.</li>
            <li>Clues must be <strong>about the meaning of the word</strong>. This means no clues based on rhyming or spelling or that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>Clues cannot use a word that is visible on a card. No being sneaky by using a different form of a word either.</li>

                    Very good. I'm just a computer so I don't know how good your clue is
                    (though I've been told that "{{correctClue}}, 2" is a good one).
