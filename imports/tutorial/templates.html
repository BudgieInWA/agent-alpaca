            In this game, your <span class="term">Spymaster</span> will give you a single word clue and a number of agents that the clue relates to. It is your job pick out those agents.

            <strong>But be careful!</strong> Some of the cards are not your agents.

        <h1>Being Spymaster</h1>
        <p>Each round, every team has a different Spymaster. When you are spymaster you will have to give a clue on each of your turns. Think of a word that relates to some of your agents but not the enemy agents <strong>and definitely not the assassin!</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clues must be <strong>one word</strong>.</li>
            <li>Clues must be <strong>about the meaning of the word</strong>. This means no clues based on rhyming or spelling or that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>Clues cannot use a word that is visible on a card. No being sneaky by using a different form of a word either.</li>
