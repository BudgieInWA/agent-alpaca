            In this game, your <span class="term">Spymaster</span> will give you a single word clue and a number of agents that the clue relates to. It is your job pick out those agents.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>But be careful!</strong> Some of the cards are not your agents.

            <li>
                Some are <span class="grey">civilians</span>

                - pick one and your turn ends.
            </li>
            <li>Some are on <span class="red">another team</span> - pick one and your turn ends, plus you've helped out the other team!</li>
            <li>There is even an <span class="black">assassin</span> - pick him and you lose the round!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>First team to find all of their agents wins the round!</p>

        <h1>Being Spymaster</h1>
        <p>Each round, every team will have one Spymaster. When you are Spymaster you must give a clue on your teams turn. Think of a word that relates to some of your agents but not to any other cards on the table.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clues must be <strong>one word</strong>.</li>
            <li>Clues must be <strong>about the meaning of the word</strong>. This means no clues based on rhyming or spelling or that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>Clues cannot use a word that is on any visible card. No being sneaky by using a different form of a word either.</li>
            <li>Take extra care to avoid clues that might cause your team to guess the assassin or the other teams agents.</li>
